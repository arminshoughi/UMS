# UMS: the University Management System
Certainly! The University Management System (UMS) is a software project aimed at enhancing the management of academic affairs within a university setting. The system is designed to be accessed by three distinct actors, namely students, masters, and administrators.

The UMS consists of three separate applications that are designed to provide a comprehensive user experience. These applications are the "share" application, the "students" application, and the "masters" application. The "share" application provides common functionality that is used across all three applications.

The "students" application is responsible for handling the functionality required by students, such as managing their course schedules, tracking their grades, and communicating with their professors. The "masters" application, on the other hand, is designed to handle the affairs of faculty members, such as managing courses, tracking student progress, and communicating with students.

To enhance the system's overall functionality and user experience, modern technologies have been employed in its implementation. The frontend of the UMS has been developed using React, a popular JavaScript library that is known for its ease of use and extensive community support. React's modular architecture and reusable components make it an excellent choice for developing complex user interfaces.

In addition to React, the UMS also utilizes Tailwind, a CSS framework that enables developers to create custom styles quickly and easily. Tailwind provides a comprehensive set of pre-defined CSS classes that can be used to create complex layouts and designs without the need for custom CSS. This allows developers to focus on the functionality of the application rather than spending time on styling and layout.

For managing the system's underlying data, PostgreSQL has been selected as the database engine. PostgreSQL is a robust and well-supported relational database management system that provides strong data integrity guarantees. It is widely used in the industry and offers advanced features such as concurrency control, transaction management, and advanced indexing capabilities.

In summary, the UMS is a comprehensive software project designed to enhance the management of academic affairs within a university setting. Its implementation utilizes modern technologies such as React, Tailwind, and PostgreSQL to provide a powerful and intuitive user experience.
